Computational Math with Java

A personal journey of learning Mathematics + Java coding together

🎯 Overview

This repository contains Java implementations of various mathematical concepts from:

Classical Algebra

Calculus

Linear Algebra

Number Theory

Mathematical Logic

Problem Solving & Algorithm

It connects deep mathematical ideas with clean Java code — improving both thinking and coding skills, step by step.

🔥 Why This Repo?

Because math isn’t just equations — it’s logic, patterns, and problem-solving.
Java converts that thinking into programs, algorithms, and real applications.

This repo helps me:

Strengthen mathematical intuition

Improve coding & problem-solving

Prepare for competitive coding

Prepare for BSc → MSc → PhD mathematics journey

Build a solid portfolio for top tech companies
